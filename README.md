# Price Predictions with AirBnb listing Data

## Motivation
I wanted to check if I can use `XGBoost` to predict AirBnb listing prices based on information that is typically found in the listing page. Price prediction and recommendations are a big part of the offering for a lot of travel related websites (hotels.com, booking.com, etc). 

## The Data
The data is from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/about.html). For this exercise, I picked up only listings from Toronto.

## Problem Type
_Regression_

## Model Used
[XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)'s regressor: `XGBRegressor`

## Analysis

The analysis can be found [here].
